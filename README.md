# Domain E-Mail Generator
Simple web-based email generator built using React. The name of the project is "Domain E-Mail Generator". The main idea behind the project is to take four main inputs, i.e. first name, last name, domain name and extension. Once the required information is furnished by the user, the application automatically integrates them together to form a domain e-mail, which can then be copied to the clipboard by the user for further usage.
